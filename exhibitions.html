                  Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                  ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see
                  and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the
                  various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn
                  a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel

                  For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
                  the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did
                  we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we
                  have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place
                  in this world.

                  Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
                  species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take
                  some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive,
                  including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
                  dinosaurs too.

                  From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
                  biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders

                  For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
                  quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
                  understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we
                  explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major
                  breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the
                  first heart transplant.

                  from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
